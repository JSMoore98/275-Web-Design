	<article><p>Hello, I am Brennen Nalley. I am currently a student at Ashland University studying Computer Science. This is currently my second year here at Ashland, but is my fourth year of school overall.
	I am from the area around Ashland, and have lived here my whole life. As a result, when I am not at school, I am often spending time with my family and playing video games, both strategy-based and fps, and am always ready to lend a helping 
	hand if you need it.</p></article>
