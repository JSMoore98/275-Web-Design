	<h2>The History our Organization</h2>
	<p>
	The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) is an educational and scientific society uniting the world’s computing educators, researchers and professionals to inspire dialogue,
	share resources and address the field’s challenges. ACM strengthens the profession’s collective voice through strong leadership, promotion of the highest standards and recognition of technical excellence. 
	ACM supports the professional growth of its members by providing opportunities for life-long learning, career development and professional networking.
	</p>
	<p>
	The ACM was founded as the Eastern Association for Computing Machinery at a meeting at Columbia University in New York on September 15, 1947. 
	Its creation was the logical outgrowth of increasing interest in computers as evidenced by several events. In January 1948, the word “Eastern” was dropped from the name of the Association. 
	In September 1949, a constitution was instituted by membership approval.
	</p>
	
	<h2>History of our Chapter</h2>
	<p>
	The student chapter at AU began over 20 years ago. 
	And has been growing steadily ever since. 
	Our chapter has often worked with other orgainzations on campus,
	such as Ashland's Mathematics Association of America club, to put on various events.
