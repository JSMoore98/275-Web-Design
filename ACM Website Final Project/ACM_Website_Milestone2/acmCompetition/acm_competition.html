		<h1>The ACM Competition</h1>
		
		<h3>What is this ACM comptition?</h3>
		<p>The ACM competition is a yearly event that we attend alongside students from many other colleges and universities. It is a good chance to 
			learn and work with others in a problem solving situation. Even if you have little to no coding experience, it can be a good event for you 
			to attend. Less experienced programmers will be paired up with more experienced programers, so even if you are not the best programmer you can 
			still help a lot with problem solving!
		
		<h3>How does this competition work</h3>
		<p>During this event students will be broken into teams, which will each work on their own. During the competition, teams are 
			give about ten problems with around five hours to work on them. During this time groups can chose to work on any of the available problems.
			Groups will submit problems as they finish them, and then they will get points for each problem they have correct.</p>
			
		<h3>How would I get more information on the Competition?</h3>
		<p>If you would like to know more about the competition, just go ahead and comtact any one of the <a href="../contactUs/contact_us.html">officers</a> as well 
			as any of the students that have gone in past years. We also devote many of our fall meetings to practice and give information about the competition, so you 
			could also attend our meetings to get information.</p>
